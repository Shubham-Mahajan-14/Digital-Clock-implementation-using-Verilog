# Digital-Clock-implementation-using-Verilog
A Verilog-based digital clock that displays time in HH:MM:SS format on an 8-digit 7-segment display. It uses clock division, BCD counters, and digit multiplexing for efficient display and real-time operation. Designed for FPGA boards like Basys 3 with a 50 MHz input clock.
